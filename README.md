# Introduction to Gemini API and Gemini API Vision

Gemini API is a powerful tool from Google AI that enables you to generate creative text formats and engage in interactive chat conversations. It offers two main models:

1. **gemini-pro**: This text-based model excels in various tasks like:
   - Generating text: Create different creative text formats like poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.
   - Answering questions: Get insightful and informative answers, even for open-ended or challenging queries.
   - Continuing conversations: Engage in natural and engaging dialogues simulating real-life conversations.

2. **gemini-pro-vision**: This multimodal model takes both text and visual information (images or videos) as input and:
   - Generates text based on images: Describe images, answer questions about them, or create creative captions.
   - Visual Question Answering (VQA): Generate precise answers about the content of images or videos.
   - Compare and contrast visuals: Identify key differences between multiple images or videos.
